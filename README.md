# user_id_str
Based on 30 of the top misinformation hashtags we extracted from twitter, I have pulled out all of the accounts associated with these hashtags.

"Retrieve_Author_ID_March.R" is the Rscript I used to complete this process.

"df_March.csv" is the new dataframe which contains all the relevant information for the extracted user_id_str.

"user_id_str_March.csv" is the desired file, containing a list of the unique "user_id_str" that used the target misinformation hashtags.
